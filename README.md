##Underground Route Finding Project

A VB.net project which calculates and displays the fastest route between any two stations on the London Tube Map (using data supplied from FoI requests to TfGL)

The application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between any two stations. The application itself is Object-Oriented, and uses WinForms to display a GUI to the user.
